Many thanks for George, David Evans (Uni. Virginia), Herbert Bos (VU), all chairs and attendees of [IEEE EuroS&P 2023](https://eurosp2023.ieee-security.org/).

Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field. Following this story of success, IEEE initiated the European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), which is organized every year in a European city.The 8th EuroS&P edition was held on July 3-7, 2023 at TU Delft ECHO and is organized by TU Delft Cybersecurity group.
