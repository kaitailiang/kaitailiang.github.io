Many thanks for George, Gene Tsudik (Uni. California), Mauro Conti (Uni. Padua), all chairs and attendees of [ESORICS 2023](https://esorics2023.org/).

Computer security is concerned with the protection of information in environments where there is a possibility of intrusion or malicious action. The aim of ESORICS is to further the progress of research and development in computer security by establishing a European community for bringing together academia and industry in this area. Progressively organized in a series of European countries, the symposium is confirmed as one of the biggest European conferences in computer security. Nowadays, the symposium has also explored the R&D directions on AI, machine learning, privacy-enhancing technology, network security, software, and hardware security, blockchain, smart contract, and real-world applied cryptography.

After the recent successful hosts in Fraunhofer (Germany, 2021) and DTU (Denmark, 2022), the 28th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS) 2023 was hosted by TU Delft in the Hague, the Netherlands.
