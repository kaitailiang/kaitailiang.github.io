Horizon Europe [TENSOR](https://tensor-horizon.eu/): provide Police Authorities a platform that facilitates the biometric evidence extraction, sharing, and storage in cross border environments, allowing them to share best practices in an automated, robust, secure, privacy-preserving and scalable manner. The full potential of biometrics technologies will be exploited, as well as their fusion with less distinctive features in case of partial evidence gathered. 

Horizon Europe [TANGO](https://tango-project.eu/partners): establish a stronger cross-sector data sharing, in a citizen-centric, secure and trustworthy manner, by developing innovative solutions while addressing environmental degradation and climate change challenges. The overall outcome is a novel platform exhibiting the following capabilities: user-friendly, secure, trustworthy, compliant, fair, transparent, accountable and environmentally sustainable data management, having at its core technology components for distributed, privacy preserving and environmentally sustainable data collection, processing, analysis, sharing and storage. This platform will promote trustworthy and digitally enabled interactions across society, for people as well as for businesses. 

Horizon Europe [REWIRE](https://www.rewire-he.eu/): provide a holistic security management framework that can safeguard IoT environments during the whole spectrum of their lifecycle, i.e., from the Design to the Runtime phases, capitalizing on trust-aware defense mechanisms that exploit emerging technologies based on Formal verification, Theorem Proofs, Open Standard Instruction Set Architectures, Trusted Computing, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence.

Horizon Europe [MLSysOps](https://mlsysops.eu/): design, implement and evaluate a complete AI-controlled framework for autonomic end-to-end system management across the full cloud-edge continuum. MLSysOps will employ a hierarchical agent-based AI architecture to interface with the underlying resource management and application deployment/orchestration mechanisms of the continuum. Energy efficiency and utilization of green energy, performance, low latency, efficient, and trusted tier-less storage, cross-layer orchestration including resource-constrained devices, resilience to imperfections of physical networks, trust, and security, are key elements of MLSysOps addressed using ML models.

H2020 [IRIS](https://www.iris-h2020.eu/): design and implement data encryption and secure data recovery techniques on consortium blockchain. 

H2020 [ASSURED](https://www.project-assured.eu/): secure data management and sharing via the combination of cryptographic tools and blockchain technique (successfully completed).
