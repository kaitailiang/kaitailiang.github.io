As the world top 10 engineering and technology University, TU Delft is keen to deliver the world-leading cybersecurity and AI R&D. The CRYPTAI lab (applied cryptography & AI) was found in 2021, and its vision is to pave the way to applied cryptography, information security and machine learning tools to achieve real-world intelligent security and privacy. The lab, led by Dr. Liang, focuses on the R&D on: (1) data protection mechanisms, in particular practical data protection and sharing for encrypted outsourced data solutions, searchable encryption, updatable encryption, lattice-based encryption/signature (post-quantum cryptography); (2) privacy-preserving machine/federated learning: attacks and countermeasures; and (3) application-driven blockchain (e.g., smart contract, oracles) development. 

The lab is mainly supported by the funding from the TU Delft, H2020, Horizon Europe and other external grants. And it has published excellent research works in the security and AI related A* conferences (e.g., USENIX Security, NDSS, Asiacrypt, CVPR) and top-tier international security journals (e.g., IEEE TIFS, IEEE TDSC), but also delivered real-world social and industrial impacts to public sectors (e.g., finance, education, hospital) via the implementation of various use cases, e.g., smart cities, IoT systems, digital supply chain.
