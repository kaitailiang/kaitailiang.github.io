Post-doc: 
======
we have 1 opening 2 years position for AI security, and post-quantum cryptography fields

- Dr. S. Fu was a postdoc at the University of Waterloo, working with Prof. Guang Gong before joining us. His research interests include cryptographic protocol, zero-knowledge proof and nonlinear cryptographic function. He has published high-quality research works in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, ESORICS, PETS, and PST. 
- Dr. R. Kromes received the PhD in Electronics from the University of Côte d'Azur, France.  His research interests are: blockchain, IoT integration with blockchain technology, cryptographic digital signature algorithms, cryptographic encryption schemes, and secure data sharing. He has led multiple cryptographic and blockchain prototypes development and implementation, providing great testbeds for the lab. He is currently a research engineer. 
- Dr. Z. Shi obtained his PhD at University of Amsterdam and his research focuses on blockchain, smart contract and oracles R\&D. 
- Dr. H. Lin focuses on the lattice-based cryptography research area. 
- Dr. M. Glazunov.  

PhD: 
======
we have 1 opening 4-year position for information security; candidate should reach English requirement (otherwise language courses will apply).  

- R. Wang received his MSc degree at the cybersecurity group, University of Southampton, United Kingdom. He is currently a PhD student with his works published in high-tier international journals and conferences, e.g., IEEE Transactions on AI, IEEE Transactions on Big Data, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, ACML, HPCC, ACSAC. His research focuses on privacy-preserving machine learning. 
- H. Chen is a Ph.D. candidate in the Cybersecurity group at the Delft University of Technology. Before that, he received the MSc degree in Mathematics from Nankai University, and was an exchange student @ Paris Saclay University, France. His research is on lattice-based cryptographic systems and has delivered publications in renowned international security conferences, e.g., ESORICS, Asiacrypt, IEEE CSF. 
- Y. Qiao is a PhD student and focuses on federated learning attacks and countermeasures. His research works have been published in ACML, etc.
