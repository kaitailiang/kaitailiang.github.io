Dr. Liang is a tenured faculty member (UD1) of the Cybersecurity group at Delft University of Technology. He received his PhD degree at City University of Hong Kong. He worked as an information security researcher at I2R (A*STAR, Singapore), post-doctoral researcher at Aalto University (Finland, supported by AoF funding), and held a permanent assistant professor position in secure systems at the University of Surrey, before joining TU Delft. During his PhD and post-doctoral studies, he was a visiting researcher at KU Leuven (Belgium), UCL (United Kingdom), IBM, and Northeastern University (United States). With over 10 years experiences on cybersecurity R&D, his main focus is on the design and implementation of cryptographic protocols to security. 

He has led as a PI in several European funded projects, e.g., TANGO, ASSURED, IRIS, and delivered real-world impact via these projects with academic and industrial partners (e.g., IBM, Fujitsu, NEC, EIT Manufacturing, BIBA, ATOS, UBITECH). He has published a series of research works, applying information security and crypto tools to address cybersecurity challenges. These publications have appeared in high-tier international information security journals and A* conferences, e.g., USENIX Security, NDSS, ESORICS (where he was honored with the Best Research Paper Award in 2015), Asiacrypt, IEEE TIFS, and IEEE TDSC. 

Beyond his research contributions, Dr. Liang has played an active role in the academic community. He has served as a Technical Program Committee, General Chair, and Steering Committee member for renowned international security and privacy conferences, including USENIX Security, IEEE EuroS&P, ESORICS, IEEE CSF, and PoPETs. Furthermore, he has made valuable contributions to ISO standards as a member of the standards committee 381027 "Cybersecurity & Privacy" at NEN. In addition to his academic pursuits, Dr. Liang serves as an Associate Editor for esteemed journals such as the Computer Journal, IEEE Systems Journal, IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence, and the EURASIP Journal on Information Security. Furthermore, he acts as a cybersecurity consultant for SMEs, sharing his expertise and guidance in the field. 

Recognizing his contributions to higher education, Dr. Liang is a Fellow of The Higher Education Academy. Since 2016, he has been actively involved in the design, teaching, and evaluation of international Master's and Bachelor's courses in countries such as Finland, the UK, and the Netherlands.
